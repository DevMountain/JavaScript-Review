//Create a Animal Constructor that has the following parameters. species, name, legs, color, food (which is an array of foods they can eat).

  //code here


//Now create a person function that creates an object and returns it (not in constructor form) that has the following parameters. name, age, height, gender

  //code here


//Create a animal array and a person array.

  //code here


//Create two instances of Animal and push those into your animal array

  //code here


//Create two instances of person and push those into your person array.

  //code here


//Now we want every instance of Animal to have a eat method. This method will choose a random item in that instances food array, then alert "(name) ' ate ' (whichever food was chosen)".

  //code here


//At this point, if we wanted to add something to every istance of person could we? 

  //Yes or no? and why or why not?



/*
  1) What happens when you use the 'new' keyword to call a Constructor function?
  2) What's a good way to describe the keyword 'this'
  3) Can a normal function which creates an object and then returns that object use the prototype?
  4) What happens if you forget to use 'new' when calling a constructor?
